## Characteristics
- P2P network
- Messages representing state transitions
	- i.e. transactions
- Set of consensus rules that governs what makes for a valid state transition
- state machine that processes transactions according to conensus rules
- a chain of cryptographically secured blocks consisting of verified and accepted state transitions
- consensus algorithm that decentralizes control over the blockchain by incentivizing participants to cooperate in the enforcement of the consensus rules
- Client diversity
	- Clients being an implementation of the software
