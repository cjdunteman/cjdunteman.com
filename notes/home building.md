# Home Building

Some notes for when I someday, hopefully, build my own home.

## General
Zero entry front entrance
36” wide doorways to accomodate wheelchairs
First floor master
Integrated sound system throughout

### Bathroom
Heated floor
Roman shower
Shower large enough for 2 at once
Steam shower
Off-set shower controls at entrance
Huge bath (no jet bubbles, will cause issues)
In every bedroom, if feasible

### Garage
Side mount garage door openers
Zero entry
Epoxy flooring
Deeper garage to fit tools and larger vehicles
120v and 240v garage
3 car minimum
Taller ceiling to lift car
Drains in floor

### Kitchen
Giant walk-in pantry
Under counter ice machine
2 fridges
Charging drawer (hide cables)
Lower kitchen cabinets should be all pull outs or drawers
Pot filler over stove
Extra 4" depth on counters for appliances and large cutting board
Drain pan under washing machine

### Utilities
Conduit to every wall where a tv might go, with power
Design it to be over insulated. Whatever the standard R value for your city, double it. Or more. Make sure the house is sealed tight. We did ICF
Get ERV installed to keep fresh air into the house to keep outside levels of CO2
All plumbing joints and valves should be copper or brass, and ball valve (no gates)

### Office
Floor outlets under desk

### Outdoor

### Basement
make the space under your garage part of the basement. Massive increase to usable space for effectively zero cost. Make sure it gets HVAC or it'll smell like a hockey locker room

## Miscellaneous

Hard flooring everywhere you can afford. Cover with rugs or carpet based rugs as desired

Don't do zoned HVAC if you have space. Go with separate units. Will save more in the long run and make every inch of the house perfect 

Pick different plumbing and light fixtures for each room. Increases value 

Stone counters only.

Put doors on pantry shelves to make them look better

If doing high end fridge freezers, two fridges in the kitchen, freezer in the pantry

Insulated garage w/ mini split

Wiring for Christmas lights controlled with internal light switch.

Wiring for HD security cameras 

Copious lighting everywhere. No such thing as too much light. Can install lower power ones or dimmers to control.

Hyper secure doors, that lock in multiple spots near the top and bottom

Prep work for pool stuff (gas, power, near where stuff would go)

Prep work for outdoor kitchen (conduit, gas, etc)

Insulation below grade under concrete 

Triple ceiling insulation 

Biggish laundry room

Sink and window in laundry

10' basement 10-12' main level 9' upper levels 

Crown molding is hard to beat for the money

As big a master closet as you can handle

Complex roof design (adds value) with simple water flow (saves hell)

Stairs should either be a grand feature of the design, or seem non existent. 

Water softener, tankless heaters w/ circulation pump, etc

Solar at build is 25% less than after the fact

400 amp service. Let's you charge 4 EVs at a time. Or 2 and dryer and stove. 

Hot/cold spigot at top of driveway

Shared interior walls have rock wool insulation to deaden sound

Over code foundation and framing

Copper piping - prevents bacteria, strong, long-lasting, but can get eaten by acidic water over time. Or use PEX, no freezing issues, no leaks, maybe cheaper

XL laundry room

Dimmers on all light switches with warm dim bulbs

Radiant heat

2 electrical panels

Electrical and data drop every wall

Pet bathing area, hand held sprayer

electric plugs in bathroom for towel warmer

Split zone AC

Warming drawer above oven

tape all exterior plywood sheathing joints (insect and air intrusion)

pre-wire for solar

drain pans under washing machine.

Dedicated curcuits for appliances

Zero entry garage

Central VAC

Greenhouse

gas outdoor connection

mud room entrance

spend excessively on things that can’t be changed later.  For example, maximize insulation and energy efficiency rather then worrying about expensive counters.  Buy the best windows available rather than worrying about stainless steel appliances

Hidden ironing board in closet with outlet and storage for iron.
