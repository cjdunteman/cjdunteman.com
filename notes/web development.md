# Web Development
Considerations:
- UI - how users consume and interact w/ your application
- Routing - how users navigate
- Data Fetching - where your data lives nad how to get it
- Rendering - when and hwere you render static or dynamic content
- Integrations - 3rd party services and how to connect them
- Performance - how to optimize
- Scalability - how your app adapts to growth
- Dev Experience - exp building and maintaining your app


## Client and Server
Client refers to the browser on a user's device 
Server refers to the computer storing application code and responds to client requests


## Rendering
#### Server-side
Fetching of external data and transformation of React components into HTML happens before result is sent to client. HTML is generated once at build time and stored in a [[CDN]] and re-used for each request.


#### Static site generation
Fetching of external data and transformation of React components into HTML happens before result is sent to client


#### Client-side rendering
Client's browser receives empty HTML shell from server along with JavaScript instructions to construct the UI.
