I recognize the stack I used for this website may be "overengineering". This could all be built in a much simpler manner, and I certainly don't need to do this for a personal website. The reason for everything I did is pretty simple; I wanted to learn these technologies and have a project to experiment with.

## The Stack

- Framework: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- Styling: [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Hosting: [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- Authentication: [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/)
- Database: [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/)
- Testing: [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

## Styling

I am using Tailwind to set up a mini design system in the config file.

The [Typography](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin) plugin enables adding styling to HTML rendered from Markdown. It would also work if I choose to transition to a CMS.

## TypeScript

I started building the website without any Typescript, as I wanted to make sure I had practical knowledge of JavaScript before moving on. Over time, I TypeScript into the mix.

## Blog

The blog posts are written in markdown and sourced locally using ContentLayer. In order to style the markdown while using Tailwind, I needed to install the `tailwindcss/typography` plugin.

The problem with doing locally source markdown is that whenever I edit a document I have to make a whole new commit and push to the repository. In the future I plan on making this a better experience with a CMS or editor within the website itself that is connected to my database.

## PlanetScale and Prisma

Prisma makes it super easy to edit the database schema, and works great with PlanetScale.

Making changes to the schema:

```sh
pscale branch create [database_name] [branch_name]

pscale connect [database_name] [branch_name] --port 3309

npx prisma db push

pscale deploy-request create [database_name] [branch_name]

pscale deploy-request deploy [database_name] [deply_request_number]
```

## Cypress

Currently only have one simple test for navigation, but planning on expanding testing for end-to-end and components.
