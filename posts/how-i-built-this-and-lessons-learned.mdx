I recognize the stack I used for this website may be "overengineering". This could all be built in a much simpler manner, and I certainly don't need to do this for a personal website. The reason for everything I did is pretty simple; I wanted to learn these technologies and have a project to experiment with.

## The Stack

- Framework: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- Styling: [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Hosting: [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- Authentication: [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/)
- Database: [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/)
- Testing: [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

### Next.js

This website is running Next.js 13.

### TailwindCSS

I am using Tailwind for styling.

### Vercel

Being that Next.js is developed by the team at Vercel, it makes sense to host projects there. The Vercel experience is as simple and easy as it gets. 

### NextAuth.js

NextAuth.js works great with Next.js (I'd hope so).

### PlanetScale

After seeing [Lee Robinson](https://leerob.io/) from Vercel using PlanetScale, I decided to give it a go. This is the first time I have used a serverless database, and PlanetScale made it really easy. 

To go alongside PlanetScale, I am using Prisma. Prisma makes it super easy to edit the database schema.

Making changes to the schema:

```sh
pscale branch create [database_name] [branch_name]

pscale connect [database_name] [branch_name] --port 3309

npx prisma db push

pscale deploy-request create [database_name] [branch_name]

pscale deploy-request deploy [database_name] [deply_request_number]
```

### Cypress

Currently only have one simple test for navigation, but planning on expanding testing for end-to-end and components.

## TypeScript
I started building the website without any Typescript, as I wanted to make sure I had practical knowledge of JavaScript before moving on. Over time, I added TypeScript into the mix.

## Blog

The blog posts are written in markdown and sourced locally using ContentLayer. In order to style the markdown while using Tailwind, I needed to install the `tailwindcss/typography` plugin.

In the future I plan on making this a better experience using a CMS, or adding my own edit functionality on the website itself.
