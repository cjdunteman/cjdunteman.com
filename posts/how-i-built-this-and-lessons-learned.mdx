I recognize the stack I used for this website may be considered "overengineering". This could all be done with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The reason for this is I wanted to try out and practice these technologies!

## The Stack

- Framework: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- Styling: [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Hosting: [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- Authentication: [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/)
- Database: [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/)
- Testing: [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

## Styling

I am using Tailwind to set up a mini design system in the config file.

The [Typography](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin) plugin enables adding styling to HTML rendered from Markdown. It would also work with a CMS.

## TypeScript

I started building the website without any Typescript, as I wanted to make sure I had practical knowledge of JavaScript before moving on. Over time, I have added TypeScript into the mix.

## Blog Posts

The blog posts are written in markdown and sourced locally using ContentLayer. In order to style the markdown while using Tailwind, I needed to install the `tailwindcss/typography` plugin.

Then in order to add my custom color theme:

## Future Plans

- Add sign in capability and commenting on blog posts using NextAuth for Authentication and PlanetScale as a DB
- Add mobile design (dropdown menu)
